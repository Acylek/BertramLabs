Coding Challenge
# To use this program, you need to initialize the CoffeePayer class and then add each coworker with their name and the price of their favorite coffee using the add_coworker method. 
# Finally, you can use the get_next_payer method to determine who should pay for the next round of coffee. The program will select the coworker who has paid the least so far. 
# If there is a tie, it will select the first coworker in the tie to pay next. After a coworker pays for coffee, the total amount they have paid is updated. This ensures that over time, everyone will pay roughly the same amount for the coffee.

# Please replace 'Name' and price with the actual names and coffee prices of the other 5 coworkers. The price should be a number representing the cost of the coworkerâ€™s favorite coffee.

# This program needs to be run locally on your machine. You can run it in any environment that supports Python. Just copy the code into a .py file and run it using a Python interpreter.

# Thank you!
